# This file technically could calculate the average score that the current gen bestWordFinder provides however the speed
# is much too slow, currently after leaving the program running for over two hours I was only able to calculate 40
# different games of the needed 2000. Many changes must be made to the algorithms used to speed up the computations
# current focus is developing an algorithm that can handle the speeds im looking for, as well as optimizing the code
# hopefully in doing this I will also fix the computational problems with the updated wordle clone where the hint
# calculator which is based off of this calculator takes way to long leaving the game frozen for multiple minutes.
# Current ideas are an SQL database storing the certain calculated patterns and the best word for those.
#
# Note as well that this skips the worst of the computation issues by assuming that 'soare' was the first word.
