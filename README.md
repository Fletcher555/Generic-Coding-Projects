Wordle Project:

  This project was built to solve Wordle and to create a Wordle clone using tkinter, the conceptual idea for the algorithm behind the solver is explained in 3Blue1Brown's youtube video on the same topic.
  
WordleSolver/ is the Wordle solver.

WordleClone/ is the Wordle clone created in tkinter.

AverageWordleSolverScoreCalc/ this file could technically calculate the average score for my bot but is extremely slow, over the first 50 words the score was 3.86.

FunctionSupport/ the 4 key functions that actually solve Wordle are contained here, these are complicated and are semi-explained in the commenting.

WordleSolverFromAnyWord/ is a file that can solve Wordle from any word the reason the main solver doesnt use this is because it is incredibly slow.
  
The CSV files are general support for the project and include the Word lists among others, many programs will not run without these.
